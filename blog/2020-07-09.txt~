<h3>Slightly Less Boring Distopia</h3>
I think a lot of Canadians could agree with me that even though we are a completely seperate country from America, our culture and news are heavily influenced and filled by American media. Now that's not to say we don't have a lot going on in the great white north but American news is just far more loud and boisterous. So here's my dumb opinion on some of that.
<br>
I think Americans need to take some good notes on what's going on and what Donald Drumpf (Trump) is saying and what specific things he's talking about. Now obviously he's an imbecile, and I wouldn't even call him a layman in power, he truly is just so so dumb, but when  he says things like "Reopen schools despite the danger", and his complete misinformation about how the infection rates work and the testing, to me there definitely is some subtext there that I hope people aren't missing out on.

<br>
He's a man of instant gratification, and especially with the post secondary issues right now, I feel like there's definitely a lobbyist whispering in his ear about forcing them to reopen, why you might ask? Profit, huge grotesque profit. Not to say Canadian institutions are much better, but an education system that is clearly being run like a private business, where President Idiot is pushing to have them open, obviously there's some weakness in how it operates if the people in charge are scared of missing a year of school. 
<br>
I just can't fathom any other reason. Is it all about appearances? He doesn't want to country to appear weak and somehow schools being closed contributes to that? Maybe, but if I know anything about American politics is it mostly fueled by the demand and whims of money and profit. True Capitalist to its core, with no room for anything else.
<br>
Hopefully this area can be another of reform and change for the American people. A country that in my opinion, is not as strongly structured and grand as it thinks it is, but I believe the people are, and they can make real change if they try.

<br><br>
Stay safe and be well out there.
