<h3>In The Beginning</h3>

Hello World, this is my first blog post here. I've had blogs and have blogged on social media before but it always seemed cooler to have your own custom built website/blog to do this on. I could have easily setup a Wordpress blog I suppose but that would have been no fun.

So for now this will be the new place I put down my thoughts although I expect no one to see it, at least not right away, and I definitely have some thoughts I'd like to put down.
