<h3>Panic Frenzy</h3>

If you're reading this at the time it was written, I don't think it really needs to be said what a crazy time it is to be living in. If you're reading this well after the fact when things are back to what I used to know as "normal" well I hope things are much better than they are right now. The worlds gone a bit jank, we're just starting to re-emerge into the lifestyle we were used to but things still aren't the same. I go to restaurants and can't recognize any of the staff from the time I went before because everyone's wearing masks, people who are working remote are doing so mostly still out of necessity, and jobs that can't have remote aren't happening at all.
<br><br>
To me everything feels like a kind of reset. There's a point of view about all this I've been thinking about a lot and I've decided I would put that down here. 
<br><br>
To start, the earth is old, very old, and it has seen more life and death and extinction that we ever have or have ever caused. The earth is also a huge ecosystem, on a macro scale you can see the connections, even if at the human perspective sometimes those things escape us. The specific perspective I'm talking about though is this. The earth can be seen a one giant ecosystem, one giant organic system, like the body of an animal or a plant. Humans, in a sense are just another piece of this body, and we function independently for our own sake but our actions contribute to the whole, similarly to bacteria or cells. I feel what's happening in the world, with COVID-19, could be seen as a reaction, a reaction to stimulus, a concequence, like an antibody or a white blood cell reacting to damage to the body. 
<br><br> 
The human race has done a lot of damage, we're not perfect, we're not evil either, but we have flaws. It is true we live in one of the most prosperous times of our history. Life expectancy is high, infant mortality is low, but there's also a lot of us. We have a lot of habits, unsustainable habits that we've been too stubborn to change from, causing damage to the world and each other. Because of those habits, despite the prosperity, we're also headed for some hard times, predicted and imperically measured hard times. This is one of those hard times we saw coming. A super virus, a virus that seems designed to kill. We spread out, mowed everything down, leaped before we looked, and ended up somewhere we didn't wanna be, but it was too late to go back. We've been tipping the scales for a long time, a short time compared to all human history but a long time, and now the earth seems to be tipping back. From a giant organism perspective, the earth is fighting back against our tyrade, and we've seen some of that with the aftermath of COVID-19. We stopped driving as much, using boats as much, flying as much, and suddenly the environment seemed to start recovering from our pollution. It was a wake up call, not a wake up call we wanted, not a wake up call I wanted, not even the wake up call we needed. COVID-19 is terrible, I wish it had never happened, I wish we had decided to make good decisions on our own and not out of necessity.
<br><br>
The warning signs for a disaster like this had been around a while, and we got caught with our pants down, but I think these times we're living in is also an opportunity. An opportunity to evolve, to become better, to be better, to go into an uncertain future stronger than ever. An opportunity to learn, to make change, and move society into a place where this won't ever happen again, because like I said, COVID-19 is terrible.
<br><br>
I've already seen one of the opportunities that the quarantine has offered, not just the new respect for cleanlyness, for appreciation of medical care and the people who provide it, but a freedom to take action in the world that we were otherwise putting off. The Black Live Matter protests (yea I'm going there).
<br><br>
I think one of the reasons the movement has gotten so large is not just because society has been pushed into this corner harder and harder since Martin Luther King Jr, but also it's a result of people being out of work due to the Virus. People have been free from the machine, the system of labour, free to get behind this movement and finally make another meaningful stride forward in equality of man*. I truly believe as others of said, that we are living in another age of progress for human rights, for black rights, for black lives. I truly hope that this stride will be bigger, that it's not just about going from open discrimination and racism to closed door racism, to hushed breath racism, to ignorant subconsious prejudices but to actual freedom from discrimination, to freedom to be oneself, to freedom to live life how you want to live it.
<br><br>
This fight is against a system and society that perpetuates it, and to tie it all together, a system that encouraged and created the pandemic we live in. That system that we've been living with since the dawn of the industrial age, has pushed our habits and tendencies in the direction of self sabotage and destruction, clear cutting forests, taking advantage of others and the natural resources unsustainably.
<br><br>
I think my point in all this is I'm sad at the state of the world, I think we could have course corrected in many ways far before this all started happening, but I'm also hopeful for the future, hopeful for a better society, a cleaner, greener, and more peaceful society, where we can all live together and where we can all continue to live on this planet we call home.
<br><br>
As always, stay safe and be well out there.
