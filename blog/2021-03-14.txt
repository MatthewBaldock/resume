<h3>Year 1 Over, Year 2 Begins</h3>

Wow it's almost been a year since I posted last and a lot has happened since.
<br><br>
Got a "covid" job, where I settled on some labour work outside of my field of edutcation because I needed some sort of income. Got an actual job related to my degree which was way more than I could have hoped for. Just had a covid scare where I was very close to being directly exposed to someone who tested positive.
<br><br>
It's been a crazy year. President Idiot isn't even President anymore, he got banned from most social media on the internet. He riled up a bunch of conspiract theorists to attack the Capitol of the U.S.
<br><br>
The Apocalypse endures, we're set to get vaccinated within 6-7 months of me writing this.
<br><br>
But yea, I'd say that's about all I wanted to say. The real reason I don't write much is I don't always have the need to splurge my thoughts. I just bottle them up and sit on them like a normal male with unhealthy emotional coping mechanisms. Yay for toxic masculinity :D. One last thing though is, you know, once it's deemed appropriate, I'm probably going to hug everyone I know next time I see them in the officially post covid/apocalyptic hellscape we are currently still drudging through. Even if we never hugged before, it's coming!!!
<br><br>
Stay safe and be well out there.
