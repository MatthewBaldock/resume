<h3>In The Beginning</h3>

Hello World, this is my first blog post here. I've had blogs and have blogged on social media before but it always seemed cooler to have your own custom built website/blog to do this on. I could have easily setup a Wordpress blog I suppose but that would have been no fun.
<br>
So for now this will be the new place I put down my thoughts although I expect no one to see it, at least not right away, and I definitely have some thoughts I'd like to put down. Mostly so I can put them somewhere and feel like I talked about them instead of annoying people in person with my rambling non-sensical thoughts.
<br>
I should at some point definitely create a proper web page instead of the simple hack job I have going on now but as a developer I don't necessarily need something that's easy to configure for the layman, as I can do whatever I want with code. Personally I'm not someone who would enjoy the title "Coding Wizard" or any other fantasy style job title with the words "Ninja", "Guru", "Artisan" or the like, but being able to program computers, write code, read network traffic really does feel like magic sometimes, but developer, engineer, and administrator, brutish old style titles are just fine with me. New wave tech is not really my style.
<br>
Anyways I'm not really sure how to sign off on these just yet as this is clearly my first one but I guess I'll just say, as it is the Apocalypse of 2020, stay safe and be well out there.
